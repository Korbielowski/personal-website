It's a project I've created for my university classes. Budget for Dummies is an application, that helps track sources of income and spending, by displaying those on a home screen, and by displaying charts summarizing user's financial activity. It's written in Python and uses <a href="https://kivy.org/" target="_blank">Kivy</a>/<a href="https://kivymd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" target="_blank">KivyMD</a> libraries for displaying GUI and <a href="https://matplotlib.org/" target="_blank">Matplotlib</a> for creating various charts. There is also JSON "database", which stores all of the spending and sources of income of a given user.

# I'm proud of:
- Simple "database" in JSON
- Dynamic charts, that update when records are added/deleted/edited
- Getting to know Kivy framework and working with GUI library
